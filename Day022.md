## Statement
```
The Indian Air Force (IAF)  is using more than 10,000 spy planes to  
go across LoC to scout for terrorist camps in Pakistan. Whenever a spy   
plane takes off for reconnaissance, the Plane ID is added to a list.  
Whenever the plane returns, the ID is again added to the same list.   

One spy plane alone has gone missing, so its ID was not added to the  
list a second time.  By the way, IDs are not guaranteed to be  
sorted or sequential.   

1. Given a list of plane IDs, write a program to print out the ID of 
the missing spy plane. 
2. If no plane is found missing, then print "All arrived!"
