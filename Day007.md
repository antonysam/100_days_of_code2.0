## Statement
```
Given two timestamps of the same day: a number of hours, minutes and seconds for both of the timestamps. The moment of the first timestamp happened before the moment of the second one. 
Calculate how many seconds passed between them.

## code
```
# Read an integer:
# a = int(input())
# Print a value:
# print(a)
#1 hr = 3600 sec
#i min = 60 sec

#get hrs
hour1 = int(input())
#get min
minutes1  = int(input())
#get seconds
sec1  = int(input())

#getting timestamp2
#get hrs
hour2 = int(input())
#get min
minutes2  = int(input())
#get seconds
sec2  = int(input())

timestamp1 = minutes1*60 + hour1*3600 + sec1
#print(timestamp1)

timestamp2 = minutes2*60 + hour2*3600 + sec2
#print(timestamp2)

#diff of two timestamps
#abs() used for -ve to +ve
print(abs(timestamp1-timestamp2))

#print(abs((minutes1-minutes2)*60 +(hour1-hour2)*3600 +(sec1-sec2)))
