## Statement
```
Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?

The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).
```
## Example
```
For example, if N = 3900, then 3900 seconds have passed since midnight. 
Therefore, the time now is 1:05am. 

So the program should print 1 65 - 1 full hour is passed since midnight, 65 full minutes passed since midnight. 
```
## Sample input
```
3900
```
## Sample output
```
1 65
```
## code
```
# Read an integer:
# a = int(input())
# Print a value:
# print(a)

# 0. Name your variables properly so that the name 
#    indicates what value they contain 
# 1. If you don't about snake_case, read about it 
#    at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case
# 2. Ask your mentor what "naming convention" means
# 3. Use a minimum of three variables and print using 
#    those variables 

#The time() method of Python's time module returns the seconds since the epoch (1/1/1970 at midnight). 
#to get no of minutes/60
#to get no of hours/60
#to get no of seconds time.time()
#to get no of days /24
#to get no of years 365.25

#import time
no_seconds = int(input())
#integer division //
no_minutes = no_seconds//60
no_hours = no_minutes//60
print(no_hours , no_minutes)
#print(time.time())
```
